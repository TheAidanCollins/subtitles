1
00:00:01,058 --> 00:00:04,309
A person's soul continues
to live on after death.

2
00:00:04,376 --> 00:00:05,576
Previously on <i>Fringe...</i>

3
00:00:05,644 --> 00:00:07,044
And all we have to do is summon
the soul to the host

4
00:00:07,095 --> 00:00:08,963
and he'll be back here
with us.

5
00:00:09,047 --> 00:00:10,915
Soul magnets.

6
00:00:10,982 --> 00:00:14,268
William is gone.
You can't bring him back.

7
00:00:14,353 --> 00:00:17,271
The soul magnets...drew
your consciousness into Olivia.

8
00:00:17,356 --> 00:00:19,473
I assure you
she is totally safe.

9
00:00:19,558 --> 00:00:22,276
Olivia's brain can...

10
00:00:22,361 --> 00:00:25,496
accommodate my consciousness
for...several weeks.

11
00:00:25,564 --> 00:00:27,064
<i>Weeks?</i>

12
00:00:27,115 --> 00:00:29,116
Not a chance.
<i>48 hours.</i>

13
00:00:29,201 --> 00:00:30,701
Then I want you
out of my agent

14
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:32,987
or I'll have Dr. Bishop
figure out how to drive you out.

15
00:00:41,713 --> 00:00:45,383
<i>The little old lady</i>
<i>from Iipanina.</i>

16
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,452
It's <i>The Girl From Ipanema.</i>

17
00:00:48,503 --> 00:00:50,054
And no.
Try again.

18
00:00:50,121 --> 00:00:52,807
Oh, Walter, can you
try something else?

19
00:00:52,891 --> 00:00:54,725
You're taking
the fun out of it.

20
00:00:54,793 --> 00:00:56,394
What's the temperature,
son?

21
00:00:57,929 --> 00:00:59,013
We're at 64 degrees.

22
00:00:59,097 --> 00:01:01,515
Perfect!
Astrid, are we ready?

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,067
Just about, Wally.

24
00:01:04,603 --> 00:01:06,771
- And you're sure this is safe, Walter.
- Perfectly.

25
00:01:06,822 --> 00:01:08,305
If everything goes
according to plan,

26
00:01:08,356 --> 00:01:09,490
the electrical current

27
00:01:09,574 --> 00:01:11,192
will latch onto
the dominant consciousness

28
00:01:11,276 --> 00:01:12,743
which is Belly's

29
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:14,078
<i>and coax it</i>
<i>into its new residence.</i>

30
00:01:14,145 --> 00:01:15,913
I meant safe
for Olivia.

31
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,331
Oh. Of course.

32
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:20,167
- No offense.
- Oh. None taken.

33
00:01:20,252 --> 00:01:23,487
<i>Olivia's mind</i>
<i>is still peacefully at rest.</i>

34
00:01:23,538 --> 00:01:25,506
<i>She won't be aware</i>
<i>of any of this.</i>

35
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,825
Though we should all take
a few steps back.

36
00:01:27,876 --> 00:01:29,009
Excuse me?

37
00:01:29,094 --> 00:01:31,846
It's perfectly safe, son.
I assure you.

38
00:01:33,832 --> 00:01:34,932
EEGs are online.

39
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:36,267
You ready, Belly?

40
00:01:36,334 --> 00:01:37,685
Aye, aye, Captain.

41
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:40,271
Do it, dear.
Okay.

42
00:01:40,338 --> 00:01:45,443
Three, two, one...

43
00:02:09,534 --> 00:02:10,634
<i>Walter?</i>

44
00:02:10,702 --> 00:02:12,086
Didn't work.

45
00:02:13,338 --> 00:02:14,355
Damn!

46
00:02:15,807 --> 00:02:18,092
<i>You can reset</i>
<i>the circuit breakers, dear.</i>

47
00:02:18,176 --> 00:02:21,479
Tell the medical school
we're returning Mr. Spencer.

48
00:02:21,546 --> 00:02:23,397
Sorry.

49
00:02:33,525 --> 00:02:35,276
So what now?

50
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,444
Well, now I guess
we try and find

51
00:02:37,529 --> 00:02:39,363
another brain-dead host.

52
00:02:39,414 --> 00:02:40,731
And what makes you think

53
00:02:40,782 --> 00:02:42,232
it's gonna go any better
this time?

54
00:02:42,284 --> 00:02:43,701
That body
fit all of your parameters,

55
00:02:43,752 --> 00:02:45,352
and we were lucky
to find him in the first place.

56
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,238
Perhaps we should
think up another idea.

57
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,673
<i>I have a new idea.</i>

58
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:52,426
You said that if you didn't
find a suitable host in 48 hours

59
00:02:52,511 --> 00:02:55,212
that you would
just go away.

60
00:02:55,263 --> 00:02:58,232
Are you suggesting
that I die?

61
00:03:00,552 --> 00:03:02,720
I'm suggesting
that I want Olivia back.

62
00:03:05,256 --> 00:03:07,608
And I'm losing patience.

63
00:03:07,692 --> 00:03:08,943
Peter--oh, Peter,
help me!

64
00:03:09,027 --> 00:03:10,227
Astrid!

65
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,290
What happened?

66
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:13,841
Call 911.

67
00:03:15,669 --> 00:03:17,136
Female. 31 years old.

68
00:03:17,187 --> 00:03:18,221
Tonic-clonic seizures.

69
00:03:18,273 --> 00:03:20,307
No response
to 4 milligrams Lorazepam IV.

70
00:03:20,358 --> 00:03:21,809
<i>BP's 190 over 110.</i>

71
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,277
<i>Trauma bay two!</i>

72
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:25,529
Pupils dilated.

73
00:03:25,614 --> 00:03:27,615
- How long has she been seizing?
- Going on 20 minutes.

74
00:03:27,682 --> 00:03:28,732
25.

75
00:03:28,817 --> 00:03:31,050
Okay. Start her on
a phenytoin drip.

76
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:32,984
- No, that's absolutely wrong!
- Excuse me?

77
00:03:33,021 --> 00:03:35,105
<i>Gentlemen, you need to step</i>
<i>outside unless you're family.</i>

78
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,057
- She's my girlfriend.
- He's my partner.

79
00:03:37,142 --> 00:03:38,609
<i>Walter-- William cannot tolerate</i>

80
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:39,727
phenytoin--he's anemic!

81
00:03:39,811 --> 00:03:40,894
<i>She's crashing.</i>

82
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:42,363
Let's defib at 360.

83
00:03:42,447 --> 00:03:44,698
Too much!
It's too much.

84
00:03:44,783 --> 00:03:46,150
What if his consciousness

85
00:03:46,201 --> 00:03:49,153
uh--uh--uh...
Changed her physiology?

86
00:03:49,204 --> 00:03:50,621
<i>A charge that size</i>
<i>directly into her heart--</i>

87
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:51,906
Walter, they have
to do something.

88
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:54,065
<i>354. Charge to 360.</i>

89
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,235
Doctor...

90
00:03:57,286 --> 00:03:59,287
<i>I've been jolted once today.</i>

91
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:00,539
<i>If you do it again...</i>

92
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,040
You will kill me

93
00:04:02,091 --> 00:04:05,594
and the young woman
I'm living inside of.

96
00:04:28,846 --> 00:04:30,646
How could this have happened.

97
00:04:30,672 --> 00:04:33,691
Dr. Bell, you assured me that
Agent Dunham was perfectly safe.

98
00:04:33,742 --> 00:04:36,244
And I believed
that she was.

99
00:04:36,328 --> 00:04:38,246
With the rats,
it was nearly two weeks

100
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,947
before I began to see
any complications.

101
00:04:40,032 --> 00:04:41,499
What rats?

102
00:04:41,566 --> 00:04:43,401
My test subjects.

103
00:04:43,468 --> 00:04:46,170
When I was first conducting
soul magnet experiments

104
00:04:46,238 --> 00:04:47,338
30 years ago.

105
00:04:47,405 --> 00:04:49,323
The rats lasted nearly two weeks

106
00:04:49,391 --> 00:04:52,093
before the host's
consciousness got lost.

107
00:04:52,177 --> 00:04:53,461
<i>I never anticipated</i>

108
00:04:53,529 --> 00:04:55,429
<i>that it would happen</i>
<i>more quickly in a human.</i>

109
00:04:55,514 --> 00:04:56,597
<i>Wait. Go back.</i>

110
00:04:56,682 --> 00:04:57,915
What do you mean,

111
00:04:57,966 --> 00:04:59,834
with the rats the host
consciousness got lost?

112
00:04:59,902 --> 00:05:02,436
It seems that
at a certain point

113
00:05:02,521 --> 00:05:04,772
the brain can no longer
accommodate

114
00:05:04,857 --> 00:05:06,958
two people's consciousness.

115
00:05:07,025 --> 00:05:09,510
So one just went away.

116
00:05:09,578 --> 00:05:11,979
<i>And no matter how hard</i>
<i>I tried,</i>

117
00:05:12,064 --> 00:05:14,031
I was unable to retrieve it.

118
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:17,068
You gave me your word.
48 hours.

119
00:05:17,119 --> 00:05:19,837
You said if you didn't find
a suitable host in 48 hours--

120
00:05:19,905 --> 00:05:22,039
I know what you're
going to suggest, young man.

121
00:05:22,107 --> 00:05:23,741
Peter's already
said as much.

122
00:05:23,792 --> 00:05:26,310
<i>But as much</i>
<i>as I may want to...</i>

123
00:05:26,378 --> 00:05:28,946
I can no longer
simply leave.

124
00:05:28,997 --> 00:05:31,299
<i>And why not?</i>

125
00:05:31,383 --> 00:05:33,217
<i>Because at this point,</i>

126
00:05:33,285 --> 00:05:35,836
your consciousness
is the only thing

127
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:37,755
keeping Olivia's
body alive.

128
00:05:37,806 --> 00:05:39,173
- That's right.
- <i>Walter...</i>

129
00:05:39,241 --> 00:05:41,659
How long before
Olivia's gone for good?

130
00:05:41,727 --> 00:05:43,644
Well...

131
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:45,146
I don't know exactly,

132
00:05:45,214 --> 00:05:48,232
but based on
what we've seen thus far,

133
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,634
I would say...

134
00:05:50,686 --> 00:05:52,970
No more than...

135
00:05:53,021 --> 00:05:55,907
a day.

136
00:05:58,076 --> 00:06:01,362
Well...Well, if we're
going to get Olivia back,

137
00:06:01,446 --> 00:06:03,164
we're not going to
do it here.

138
00:06:03,248 --> 00:06:06,450
Okay...what about this?

139
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:09,403
What if we try
to activate her chi?

140
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:10,988
Acupuncture?

141
00:06:11,056 --> 00:06:13,457
<i>Yes. We try and stimulate</i>

142
00:06:13,508 --> 00:06:14,926
her seventh chakra.

143
00:06:14,993 --> 00:06:16,410
Pure consciousness.

144
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:18,246
As much as I love
the notion,

145
00:06:18,313 --> 00:06:19,647
it could take
dozens of sessions

146
00:06:19,715 --> 00:06:21,399
spread over several days.

147
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:23,317
You said we had to find
a way to pull Olivia out

148
00:06:23,385 --> 00:06:25,720
in 24 hours.

149
00:06:25,787 --> 00:06:28,556
What if we don't?

150
00:06:28,624 --> 00:06:32,193
<i>Have to find a way</i>
<i>to pull her out, I mean.</i>

151
00:06:32,261 --> 00:06:33,761
What are you thinking?

152
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:35,313
<i>What if, instead of</i>
<i>trying to find a way</i>

153
00:06:35,364 --> 00:06:37,031
<i>to pull Olivia out,</i>

154
00:06:37,115 --> 00:06:39,516
we try and find a way

155
00:06:39,568 --> 00:06:42,119
to go in?

156
00:06:42,187 --> 00:06:43,871
- Peter...
- I'm just saying consider it.

157
00:06:43,956 --> 00:06:45,990
We know he has a healthy ego.

158
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,292
You don't start a company like
Massive Dynamic without an ego.

159
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,493
But do you really think

160
00:06:49,544 --> 00:06:51,379
that he would let Olivia die
just so--

161
00:06:51,463 --> 00:06:53,147
he could go on living?

162
00:06:53,215 --> 00:06:54,415
I don't know.

163
00:06:54,483 --> 00:06:56,117
Maybe, maybe not.

164
00:06:56,184 --> 00:06:57,918
But on the list of
accomplishments

165
00:06:58,003 --> 00:06:59,287
for William Bell,

166
00:06:59,354 --> 00:07:01,505
cheating death would
certainly rank number one.

167
00:07:01,573 --> 00:07:03,424
Hmm.
<i>Kids.</i>

168
00:07:03,508 --> 00:07:07,211
We think that we
have found a way

169
00:07:07,262 --> 00:07:09,563
to bring
Olivia's mind back.

170
00:07:09,648 --> 00:07:11,715
And to remove William's.

171
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:13,401
Whole brain emulation.

172
00:07:13,468 --> 00:07:15,519
<i>It's another one of</i>
<i>Belly's old projects.</i>

173
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,655
It describes
how an inorganic host

174
00:07:17,722 --> 00:07:20,241
can house organic material.

175
00:07:20,325 --> 00:07:23,160
We're gonna put Belly
in the computer.

176
00:07:23,228 --> 00:07:25,112
<i>Much to do and not much time.</i>

177
00:07:25,197 --> 00:07:27,031
While we go into
Olivia's mind,

178
00:07:27,082 --> 00:07:28,416
you can get to work
on this.

179
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,668
It's very self-explanatory.

180
00:07:34,673 --> 00:07:37,758
Enter Olivia's mind how?

181
00:07:37,843 --> 00:07:40,177
We've done it before--

182
00:07:40,245 --> 00:07:42,913
when Olivia and Agent Scott
shared the dream state.

183
00:07:42,964 --> 00:07:44,131
It's a simple variation.

184
00:07:44,216 --> 00:07:45,800
Walter.

185
00:07:45,884 --> 00:07:49,770
Every brain generates
a quantifiable electric field.

186
00:07:49,855 --> 00:07:51,138
<i>If we can...</i>

187
00:07:51,223 --> 00:07:53,474
Tune ours precisely
to Olivia's,

188
00:07:53,558 --> 00:07:55,476
then we can share her mind.

189
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,811
We can go looking for her.

190
00:07:56,895 --> 00:07:57,812
- <i>Walter?</i>
- Hmm?

191
00:07:57,896 --> 00:07:59,363
Where do you keep
the neurosensors?

192
00:07:59,431 --> 00:08:01,032
Back shelf
by the fish food.

193
00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:02,233
<i>If I remember</i>
<i>correctly,</i>

194
00:08:02,284 --> 00:08:04,985
you had to put
an electromagnetic probe

195
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,370
<i>into her brain</i>
<i>and dose her</i>

196
00:08:06,438 --> 00:08:08,205
with a massive amount
of hallucinogenics.

197
00:08:12,744 --> 00:08:14,628
LSD!

198
00:08:14,713 --> 00:08:16,497
That could solve
the superego problem.

199
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:19,750
Ohh... Oh, that is
brilliant, son!

200
00:08:19,801 --> 00:08:21,635
This may be a weird
time to ask,

201
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,888
but have you
ever tripped?

202
00:08:23,955 --> 00:08:25,389
- Are you suggesting that--
- Of course!

203
00:08:25,457 --> 00:08:27,591
It's Olivia's mind
we're entering.

204
00:08:27,642 --> 00:08:28,843
Presumably,
it will be some

205
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,095
maze-like iteration
of her psyche.

206
00:08:31,146 --> 00:08:33,481
Memories are subconscious.
You know her better than anyone.

207
00:08:33,565 --> 00:08:35,599
If she is lost in her mind,

208
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,735
we need you to guide us.

209
00:08:37,802 --> 00:08:38,986
Astrid!

210
00:08:39,071 --> 00:08:42,773
We need to mix up
2,000 milligrams of LSD

211
00:08:42,824 --> 00:08:45,609
and--and we need
some sugar cubes. Please.

212
00:08:50,449 --> 00:08:51,999
You first, son.

213
00:08:53,335 --> 00:08:55,086
Don't be nervous.

214
00:08:55,153 --> 00:08:57,538
I imagine there are
things in this very lab

215
00:08:57,622 --> 00:08:58,989
that are as mind-blowing

216
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,258
as anything that I've
experienced while tripping.

217
00:09:01,326 --> 00:09:03,294
Besides...

218
00:09:03,345 --> 00:09:05,829
This is merely a conduit
to Olivia's mind.

219
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:07,181
And when we get there,

220
00:09:07,265 --> 00:09:11,435
we should all be very cogent.

221
00:09:11,503 --> 00:09:13,637
In 30 to 45 minutes...

222
00:09:13,688 --> 00:09:16,440
But I've added an accelerant.

223
00:09:16,508 --> 00:09:18,509
You can start to prepare
the sedative, dear.

224
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,479
I'll go and help Belly.

225
00:09:22,647 --> 00:09:24,565
Peter, don't worry.

226
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:26,183
I'll keep my eye
on the monitors.

227
00:09:26,251 --> 00:09:27,952
I'll make sure
you're okay.

228
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:31,205
It's not me
I'm worried about.

229
00:09:31,289 --> 00:09:32,673
I'm pretty sure
there's a good reason

230
00:09:32,741 --> 00:09:35,075
why we can't enter
each other's minds.

231
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,329
What if we kick something
loose in there?

232
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,696
Right now,

233
00:09:39,748 --> 00:09:41,799
I think you're
her only hope.

234
00:09:43,802 --> 00:09:45,553
How's it coming?

235
00:09:45,637 --> 00:09:47,054
So far so good.

236
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:52,209
What?

237
00:10:01,436 --> 00:10:03,154
You're bald.

238
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,058
I think
he's an observer.

239
00:10:09,828 --> 00:10:11,662
It's okay, Peter.

240
00:10:11,729 --> 00:10:13,247
Walter, we're ready.

241
00:10:13,331 --> 00:10:15,332
Oh. Good.
Bring him over.

242
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,868
It's okay.

243
00:10:36,254 --> 00:10:38,589
Drugs?

244
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,757
Yep. Lots of 'em.

245
00:10:46,097 --> 00:10:47,565
Whew.

246
00:10:47,616 --> 00:10:48,782
Ooh...

247
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,437
That tickles.

248
00:11:24,603 --> 00:11:25,769
<i>Peter!</i>

249
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,187
<i>Peter!</i>

250
00:11:27,272 --> 00:11:29,440
Over here!

251
00:11:29,491 --> 00:11:31,808
I think you better
help me down.

252
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:37,348
Whoa...Whoa!

253
00:11:42,853 --> 00:11:44,538
No! No! No!

254
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:46,406
Of all the places
to grab a man,

255
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,574
you choose the crotch
of my pants!

256
00:11:47,658 --> 00:11:48,875
Hey, I broke
your fall, didn't I?

257
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,076
You spared me no embarrassment
in the process.

258
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:51,828
I thought you said
none of this was real anyway.

259
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,246
I said that everything
is a product

260
00:11:53,331 --> 00:11:54,998
of Olivia's subconscious.

261
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:56,833
My feelings
are most definitely real.

262
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:58,168
Where's Belly?

263
00:11:58,219 --> 00:12:00,720
I have no idea.

264
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:02,505
He must have entered
somewhere else.

265
00:12:02,557 --> 00:12:05,008
It doesn't matter.
We're here for Olivia anyway.

266
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:07,177
So what's the next step
in the plan?

267
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:09,813
There is one,
right, Walter?

268
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,182
Please tell me that
the plan doesn't end here.

269
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:13,650
Of course not!

270
00:12:13,717 --> 00:12:15,936
The plan...
is to find Olivia

271
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,571
and guide her out.

272
00:12:19,824 --> 00:12:21,575
We just have to
start looking.

273
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:23,577
Wal--
Walter!

274
00:12:23,661 --> 00:12:25,528
Amazing, isn't it?

275
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,697
How are we supposed
to pick Olivia out?

276
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:30,750
<i>All these people are dressed</i>
<i>like they raided her closet.</i>

277
00:12:30,835 --> 00:12:31,835
More likely,
she equipped them

278
00:12:31,902 --> 00:12:32,836
according
to her preferences.

279
00:12:32,903 --> 00:12:34,621
Our fault, I fear.

280
00:12:34,705 --> 00:12:37,707
Cortexiphan subjects
experience a strong desire

281
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:40,293
to blend in,
to stay in the background.

282
00:12:40,378 --> 00:12:42,462
They were designed
that way.

283
00:12:42,546 --> 00:12:44,681
Designed that way?

284
00:12:44,748 --> 00:12:46,516
Peter.

285
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:47,951
What is that?

286
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:50,470
<i>I believe it's morse code.</i>

287
00:12:50,554 --> 00:12:52,305
<i>And unless I'm mistaken,</i>

288
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:56,092
that's an S.O.S.

289
00:12:58,896 --> 00:13:01,114
What are you doing?

290
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:04,451
Chocolate pudding.
My favorite.

291
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:05,819
<i>Ah, come on, Walter,</i>

292
00:13:05,903 --> 00:13:08,071
you can't seriously be thinking
about eating right now.

293
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:09,906
Of course not.
I just had lunch.

294
00:13:13,411 --> 00:13:14,661
What are you saying?

295
00:13:14,745 --> 00:13:17,447
I'm asking who it is.

296
00:13:21,135 --> 00:13:23,336
It's Olivia!
She's found us.

297
00:13:23,421 --> 00:13:25,755
Tell her to stay there.
We're on our way.

298
00:13:31,312 --> 00:13:33,280
Any changes?

299
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:35,982
No.

300
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:39,469
<i>They all seem oddly</i>
<i>peaceful.</i>

301
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:47,027
Do you really think
it's possible

302
00:13:47,111 --> 00:13:49,362
to upload a person's
consciousness to a computer?

303
00:13:49,447 --> 00:13:52,082
I don't know.

304
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:53,883
I'm just following
Bell's instructions.

305
00:13:53,951 --> 00:13:56,069
<i>The aim</i>
<i>is for the computer</i>

306
00:13:56,137 --> 00:13:58,605
<i>to mimic the behavior</i>
<i>of neurons.</i>

307
00:14:03,827 --> 00:14:05,078
I never understood

308
00:14:05,146 --> 00:14:07,864
why Walter
was so drawn to licorice.

309
00:14:07,932 --> 00:14:10,033
But look at it.

310
00:14:10,101 --> 00:14:13,136
The swirl...

311
00:14:16,057 --> 00:14:19,959
It's Bernini's
spiral altar at St. Peter's.

312
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:23,596
It...doesn't end.

313
00:14:23,664 --> 00:14:26,032
Did you clean that up?

314
00:14:26,117 --> 00:14:27,484
Yeah.

315
00:14:27,535 --> 00:14:29,685
<i>I thought I'd help you</i>
<i>clear the table.</i>

316
00:14:29,737 --> 00:14:32,539
You touched the tray
with the sugar cubes?

317
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:34,190
Sure.

318
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:36,326
Why?

319
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:41,514
Have you ever taken
LSD?

320
00:14:49,423 --> 00:14:51,191
The towers
are out of proportion.

321
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:52,826
We should be closer
by now.

322
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:53,893
It's Olivia's mind

323
00:14:53,978 --> 00:14:55,645
assigning importance.

324
00:14:55,712 --> 00:14:57,814
Our surroundings represent

325
00:14:57,881 --> 00:15:00,600
her emotional landscape,
don't forget.

326
00:15:02,553 --> 00:15:03,987
<i>Oh. Oh, my.</i>

327
00:15:04,054 --> 00:15:05,822
Olivia's stepfather.

328
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:08,224
What? Where?

329
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:09,743
<i>Over there!</i>
<i>That's--that's him!</i>

330
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:12,912
Olivia's stepfather.

331
00:15:18,902 --> 00:15:20,903
<i>Hmm.</i>

332
00:15:20,955 --> 00:15:23,456
Walter, I'm...

333
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:26,292
Getting a bad feeling
about this.

334
00:15:26,377 --> 00:15:28,678
Any suggestions?

335
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:32,081
<i>Yes.</i>

336
00:15:32,133 --> 00:15:34,134
Run!

337
00:15:41,925 --> 00:15:43,309
Oh!

338
00:15:43,394 --> 00:15:45,228
The cab!

339
00:15:47,648 --> 00:15:49,032
Wait, wait, wait.
You're driving?

340
00:15:49,099 --> 00:15:51,117
Okay.

341
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,451
What the hell was that?

342
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,590
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

343
00:16:28,656 --> 00:16:32,325
Peter...I made a skid.

344
00:16:33,444 --> 00:16:35,778
There. The elevators.

345
00:16:39,283 --> 00:16:41,751
Walter! Peter.
Hello.

346
00:16:41,818 --> 00:16:44,537
Nina! Are you a sight
for sore eyes!

347
00:16:44,622 --> 00:16:46,506
We're looking for
Olivia.

348
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,041
Olivia?
We think she's in an office

349
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,459
near the top
on the north side.

350
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,927
Walter thinks
it's Bell's office.

351
00:16:50,994 --> 00:16:53,596
Okay.

352
00:16:54,998 --> 00:16:57,550
This elevator
is the fastest one.

353
00:16:57,635 --> 00:16:59,769
It will take you directly

354
00:16:59,836 --> 00:17:01,604
to the private lobby
of the upper floors.

355
00:17:10,865 --> 00:17:12,031
- Walter!
- Oh!

356
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,542
Whoa--

357
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:23,877
okay.

358
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,885
She tried to kill us.

359
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:33,887

<i>Why is everyone trying</i>
<i>to kill us?</i>

361
00:17:37,874 --> 00:17:39,926
I don't like
this place.

362
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,327
Me neither.

363
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,943
Olivia?
You in there?

364
00:17:57,027 --> 00:17:58,578
Careful, Peter.

365
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:00,246
We don't know
what her mind's put

366
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:01,864
on the other side
of this door.

367
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,066
We should be ready
for anything.

368
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:09,238
Belly.

369
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:12,508
I lied.
Olivia's not here.

370
00:18:12,576 --> 00:18:15,578
I was concerned
if you knew it was just me,

371
00:18:15,646 --> 00:18:17,430
<i>Peter wouldn't let you</i>
<i>come rescue me.</i>

372
00:18:17,498 --> 00:18:20,800
Belly...
Why are you a cartoon?

373
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:29,091
I'd ask yourselves
the same question.

374
00:18:43,304 --> 00:18:45,188
I found myself
on the street,

375
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:46,941
but neither of you
were nearby.

376
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:48,910
And then a car
tried to run me down.

377
00:18:48,977 --> 00:18:51,979
So I came here.

378
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,082
I assumed it would be
a safe haven...

379
00:18:54,149 --> 00:18:56,985
But then I encountered Nina.

380
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,821
I don't understand.

381
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,257
If this is all
a projection of Olivia's mind,

382
00:19:02,324 --> 00:19:03,792
why is everything
turning against us?

383
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:06,244
When she came to us in the lab,
she asked for help.

384
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,829
What I'm starting to think

385
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,465
is that when my mind
entered hers,

386
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:13,000
her ego became confused--

387
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:15,253
her sense of self.

388
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,604
<i>Which, in turn,</i>

389
00:19:16,672 --> 00:19:20,108
initiated the darker part
of her subconscious

390
00:19:20,175 --> 00:19:22,644
allowing her deepest
fears to run rampant.

391
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,813
Explain that.

392
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:27,365
We're saying
that Olivia is not aware

393
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:30,318
that Belly's consciousness
entered hers.

394
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:33,788
As far as she's concerned,
one minute she was fine,

395
00:19:33,856 --> 00:19:35,156
the next minute
she was set adrift

396
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:37,191
in her innermost thoughts.

397
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:40,462
It's her fears that are
causing the siege.

398
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:42,497
Then, in that case,
she's not lost, she's hiding.

399
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:43,748
That's what she does.

400
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:47,201
When Olivia is afraid,
she retreats.

401
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:48,219
That's not good.

402
00:19:48,304 --> 00:19:50,171
And being lost is?

403
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,424
Yes, it's better.

404
00:19:52,508 --> 00:19:54,509
I expected there to be
a logical trail

405
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,760
whereby we could
track her

406
00:19:55,845 --> 00:19:58,196
because Olivia
wanted to be found.

407
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:00,381
If she's hiding...

408
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:03,234
I'm afraid we're looking
for a needle in a haystack.

409
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:05,153
He's right, son.

410
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,439
Everything in her mind
is dangerous

411
00:20:07,523 --> 00:20:10,075
and hostile to her now.

412
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,527
How can we expect to find her

413
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:15,330
if she's frightened
of everything, us included?

414
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:20,668
Because she'd do exactly
what you did--

she'll find a place

541
00:30:06,464 --> 00:30:09,233
and a 60-watt light bulb.

542
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,635
And hurry, dear!

543
00:30:28,753 --> 00:30:30,621
Where are we going,
Peter?

544
00:30:30,672 --> 00:30:34,792
Olivia told me she lived
on the military base!

545
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,197
Olivia once told me

546
00:30:57,282 --> 00:30:59,316
that she sometimes thinks
about what it would be like

547
00:30:59,367 --> 00:31:01,552
to just be normal.

548
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,037
She said she falls
asleep sometimes

549
00:31:03,121 --> 00:31:04,772
thinking about what it
would be like

550
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:07,658
if her life hadn't taken
the turn that it did.

551
00:31:07,709 --> 00:31:09,910
She told me that the last
time she remembered

552
00:31:09,995 --> 00:31:11,662
feeling that way
was the day before

553
00:31:11,713 --> 00:31:15,716
she met you and Walter
at the cortexiphan trials.

554
00:31:20,589 --> 00:31:22,940
I think she's
down there somewhere.

555
00:31:23,008 --> 00:31:26,143
In that house, on that day.
Hiding out.

556
00:31:28,563 --> 00:31:32,232
They're all the same.
How will we find her?

557
00:31:32,317 --> 00:31:36,020
Her real dad painted
the door red.

558
00:31:36,071 --> 00:31:37,655
He told her
that it was good luck.

559
00:31:37,722 --> 00:31:39,723
The army told them it was
against regulations,

560
00:31:39,774 --> 00:31:44,261
but he was an important man,
so they let it slide.

561
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:58,792
There aren't many
streets left, Peter.

562
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,413
Maybe the door
was painted green again

563
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:05,415
after they moved away.

564
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:08,752
It wasn't.

565
00:32:19,848 --> 00:32:22,282

566
00:32:22,367 --> 00:32:25,285

568
00:32:27,455 --> 00:32:30,040
I've taken us
so far off course...

569
00:32:30,108 --> 00:32:32,409

of that

570
